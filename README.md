# Credit-Card-Risk-Analysis
Credit card usage has become increasingly prevalent in our society, with more people relying on credit cards for day-to-day transactions. However, with the rise in credit card usage comes an increase in credit card fraud and default rates, which can have significant financial implications for both consumers and financial institutions.

To address this challenge, this project aims to develop a machine learning-based credit card risk analysis model. The objective of this model is to predict the likelihood of credit card fraud or default based on a range of relevant factors such as payment history, credit limit, outstanding balance, and other credit-related data.

To achieve this, we will leverage various machine learning techniques such as supervised learning algorithms like logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines. We will also use unsupervised learning techniques like clustering and anomaly detection to identify patterns and outliers in the data.
